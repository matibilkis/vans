#### important changes, there are also some tips in case things do not work ####

1. deleted the give_energy method in variational.
2. killed the nasty lower_bound_Eg
3. killed the max_time_training depeding on noise/qubits. Set to 5 mins now.
4. changed the adam optimizer for the SGD with algoritm 4 of qacq (actually implemented options there)
5. changed the strength of adding the random_perturbations; now it's almost vanishing (THIS IS IMPORTANT, DISCUSS IT WITH LUKASZ). In case we want to calim the BP mitigation...

6. changed the min_delta to 1e-6 (this can be changed as well..) THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING SUBTLE
7. changed the give_energy thing as well. In vqe_handler there's no more give_energy, I retrieve the energy from the last value of the training history (we could actually take the best one instead, but I wouldn't know how to fetch the trainable variables, maybe with a callback).

8. killed train_model function
9. added this to README.md
