# VANS
In this branch we leave the piece of code that makes use of DensityMatrixSimulator simulator of cirq. The TFQ model uses as a backend to optimize over a noisy version of the circuit, but the overall code results very slow. There's an [open thread](https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/issues/250) in this regard, so this branch will be paused and hopefully re-activated if there's a fast C++ implementation for quantum channels.
