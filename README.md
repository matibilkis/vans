# VANS

We present VANS, an algorithm that uses a variable ansatz structure to do VQE. In short, identity-resolution block of gates are proposed to be appended in the circuit, then VQE is run on the proposed circuit and if the obtained energy is lowered, the modification is accepted.

## Algorithm description

[To be done, but the file <i>main.py</i> is a good overview, in particular the main loop]

## Code structure

[To be done, this description is considered necessary since the code is structure by calling different mododules (see utilities folder). For instance, if in the future the VQE module is willing to be modified, enhance (for example replace adam with rosalin), this description will help a lot.]

## Noiseless circuit results

In the following we consider 4 qubit circuits and showcase VANS on two different scenarios: Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) and XXZ model. The initial circuit parametrization is a <i>product ansatz</i>, consisting in rotations around x-axis at each qubit.

Xxz model was introduced since this [meta-VQE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13545) was out recently. Their task is a bit more general than just minimize find the ground state: they try to <i>learn</i> ground state energy profiles as hamiltonian hyperparameters change (like predicting how the circuit that prepares ground state in between of unseen points is). Besides the paper (which works with 14 qubits), they show off their method in a [certain tutorial](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/Meta-VQE/blob/master/Meta-VQE.ipynb) on a 4-qubit xxz model. I was curious to see how our algorithm compares with the plot they report, and it seems to be better ours (no idea of the details though, maybe that plot is not the best meta-VQE can do; still they present it). Â¿Maybe we can try xxz with even more qubits (14 as a goal) if we consider this relevant?


## VANS vs. true ground energy
In the following we present the results obtained after running VANS for 100 (50) iterations, for TFIM (XXZ) model. We despict the lowest energy found for a sweep over different hamiltonian parameters. For each configuration, the evolution of the ansatz can be found in the github directory <i> results/model/4Q-configuration/evolution.txt </i>.

### "Learning" curves
we also depict (i) the lowest energy found, and (ii) the energy of the current circuit accepted by VANS, as evolved during algorithm iterations.

Due to the acceptance of a higher energy circuit (up to some threshold, set to be %1 of relative energy w.r.t lowest energy found so far), in some cases energy in (ii) goes up. We observe that, for some cases, the initial ansatz appears to be sufficiently good. Nonetheless this accuracy will depend (not exclusively) on the learning rate set used in VQE, which in this example was set to 0.005; this value can be found, among others, in the run info.txt file, placed inside each run directory, and under the name qlr.

## Noisy circuits

<i>Note:</i> we are currently not estimating a cost function, from some finite number of shots, but rather using the expected value (infinite shots). A finite number of shots can be easily included, but we have not done it yet.

We implement quantum channels that can be decomposed as a sum of unitary transformations; for this we take a batch of circuits, each affected by a possible unitary transformation with some probability. This permits the usage of the fast C++ TFQ simulator, since Density Matrix Simulator is not implemented (yet) - check the open issue [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/quantum/issues/250).

Quite arbitrarily from our side, the channel acts before each gate that appears in the circuit (read from left to right). In case of CNOT gates, the channel is applied at both control and target. We illustrate this in a simple 4-qubit circuit, made up of rotations around the x-axis: we take the symmetric depolarizing channel that with probability <i>1-p</i> acts as the identity, whereas with <i>p</i> applies a Pauli gate (X, Y, Z), uniform-randomly chosen.

### Some trivial checks
On the way, we have also checked that this kind of procedure approximates well the DensityMatrixSimulator of cirq; this can be found [here](results/optimized_product_ansatz_noisy/noise_VANS_and_TFQ.ipynb). Furthermore, we checked how the results of doing VQE varies on this simple ansatz, if the noise strength is increased

### Some results
Approximating noisy channels in the context described above and running VANS on top of this is feasible, but sligthly expensive. On a rather powerful laptop, but without GPU and depending on the particular circuit, each VQE optimization takes more than 30 minutes and hence that VANS-iteration step is considered skipped). On the way, we stress that VANS detects whether a GPU is available to be used, and if so, uses it (we did some little experiments using google colab's GPU, noticing a considerable increment on the speed that VQE is done).

Nonetheless, we did a run of 50-iterations-VANS. We considered 3 qubits and TFIM on a fixed value g and J, for three different values of depolarizing channel strength. We observe a nice reduction of circuit's number of CNOTS for only one of the cases, since the remaining two got stuck. Find the circuits generating the results [here](https://github.com/matibilkis/vans/blob/implicit_noise/noisy_TFIM_3qubits):

### What to do next
We can either try different channels (that admit this convex sum of unitary transformations: it'd be straightforward to implement this in the current version of the code). We can also think on more qubits, although memory requirements are already quite high for my laptop (to generate the results on depolarizing channel on 3 qubits using currently 13 out of 16 GB available, which delayed other projects I should not delay).

It would be desirable to run more simulations if there is enough interest.

## Some ideas for the future
<ul>
<li> In case that it is desired to limit the circuit's depth, a simple way out it's to just limit it: don't allow new identity resolutions that would make the circuit longer than a certain threshold. </li>

<li> In case that we want to scale the algorithm up (in terms of qubits), we can think on increase the number of identity resolutions added per VANS step </li>

<li> If many cores are available, it sounds reasonable to parallelize the VQE in the batched approximation of noisy channels. I do remember Arthur Pesah mentioning this greatly improves the speed of TFQ. </li>

<li> Although the whole idea of VANS is quite simple, it serves as a nice way to generate datasets of approximate-ground-state-preparing circuits of the corresponding hamiltonians. This opens the door to play with machine learning methods. For instance one try to see if there's some correlation between the discovered circuits and the hamiltonian parameters. </li>

</ul>

## Things that are patched and better solutions are welcome

Rule 5 of utilities.simplifier, we use sympy.solve to reduce many consecutive 1-qubit unitary gates to Rz Rx Rz, but this solution is not very elegant.
